This repository contains firmware for my 3 time zone clock based on the [Adafruit Feather M0 Wifi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010). This project is very incomplete and is unlikely to be reproducible with the code listed here.

Some of the software components (eg. samd21 drivers) may be useful to others, so I'm making this repository public, but have no intention to maintain it long term.
